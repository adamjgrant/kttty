kttty is a webcomic created by me, the person who created it. It's kind of an 
experiment based on something my mom once told me.

My brothers and my father all watched TV pretty regularly over the weekend whereas 
my mother liked to read books. When I was very young, I remember asking my mom
why she liked books better when you couldn't see the scenes happening. Her response
was simply that she got to use her own imagination to make the scenes the way she
saw fit.

In creating kttty, I noticed a trend in webcomics intentionally taking form of
crude drawings. What if we just did no drawings? Aren't type and colors beautiful
on their own? And how about taking a page from my mother and letting us enjoy
the illustrations of our own imagination?

Also, the comics are drawn in full HTML and are responsive to your device. That's
pretty cool, right?
